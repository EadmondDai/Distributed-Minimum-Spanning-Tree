Each node would be managed by different thread.
They will be communicating using a common data structure. Two nodes can
communicate only if they are joined by an edge. Communcation would be sort of a
message queuing system where two nodes would share the queue and a condition
variable. The communication would be initiated with the help of wait() and
notify().

Main thread would be responsible to set everyting up: Setting the global
structure, setting each thread's state to sleeping and then randomly invoking
one of the threads.
