Distributed-Graph-Algorithms
============================

This is a distributed program that implements a distributed Minimum Spanning Tree in C++.


The distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem involves the construction of a minimum spanning tree by a distributed algorithm, in a network where nodes communicate by message passing. Instead if multiple processes, I'll be using multiple threads to simulated the real world scenario.
