Distributed-Graph-Algorithms
============================

This is a distributed program that implements a distributed Minimum Spanning Tree in C++.

Also know as GHS algorithm. The GHS algorithm of Gallager, Humblet and Spira is one of the best-known algorithms in distributed computing theory.

The distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem involves the construction of a minimum spanning tree by a distributed algorithm, in a network where nodes communicate by message passing. Instead if multiple processes, I'll be using multiple threads to simulated the real world scenario.

If anyone wants to use this code you can freely do so. If you have any doubt then you can email me. I'll be happy to help :)
